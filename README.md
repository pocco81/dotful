# ðŸ“‹ Dotman

Dotman is a dotfiles manager written in POSIX shell. It only depends on `ls`, `ln`, `cp` and `mkdir`, which are basic core utilities.

It manages dotfiles through profiles, which are directories that store the actual dotfiles. There is a local database (plain text file) that stores each entry's destination, alias and their parent profile.

## Usage

```shell
# this command provides you with everything you need to know
$ dotman --help
```

But the short TL;DR is:
```
$ dotman add my_file	# adds 'my_file' to the default profile
$ dotman install		# installs the entire profile
$ dotman status		# checks the status of each file in the profile and their destinations
```

The tool may be configured through either environment variables or CLI options.

## Bootstrapping

The following one-liner will download `dotman` and install it under `/usr/local/bin` (requires `sudo` privileges):

```shell
sudo sh -c 'curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pocco81/dotman/main/dotman -o /tmp/dotman && chmod +x /tmp/dotman && install /tmp/dotman /usr/local/bin && rm /tmp/dotman'
```
> Note: to uninstall it just run `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/dotman`

## Development and Testing

Feel free to `git clone https://github.com/pocco81/dotman.git`. There is a makefile that provides the following targets:

1.	`install`: installs `dotman` under `$(BIN)`.
2. `uninstall`: removes `$(BIN)/dotman`.
3. `playground`: creates a safe testing environment inside of `$(PL)` and provides instructions on how to use `dotman` within it.

Default parameters:
- `BIN` = `/usr/local/bin`
- `PL` = `/tmp/_home`

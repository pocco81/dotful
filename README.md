	It is a <a href="https://github.com/pocco81/dotful/blob/main/dotful">single script</a> that only depends on <code>ls</code>, <code>ln</code>, <code>cp</code> and <code>mkdir</code>, which are basic core utilities.
	It manages dotfiles through profiles, which are directories that store the actual dotfiles. There is a local database (plain text file) that stores each entry's destination, alias and their parent profile.
</p>

### Usage

```shell
# this command provides you with everything you need to know
$ dotful --help
```

But the short TL;DR is:
```
$ dotful add my_file  # adds 'my_file' to the default profile
$ dotful install     # installs the entire profile
$ dotful status      # checks the status of each file in the profile and their destinations
```

The tool may be configured through either environment variables or CLI options.

### Bootstrapping

The following one-liner will download `dotful` and install it under `/usr/local/bin` (requires `sudo` privileges):

```shell
sudo sh -c 'curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pocco81/dotful/main/dotful -o /tmp/dotful && chmod +x /tmp/dotful && install /tmp/dotful /usr/local/bin && rm /tmp/dotful'
```
> Note: to uninstall it just run `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/dotful`

&nbsp;

### Development and Testing

Feel free to `git clone https://github.com/pocco81/dotful.git`. There is a makefile that provides the following targets:

1.	`install`: installs `dotful` under `$(BIN)`.
2. `uninstall`: removes `$(BIN)/dotful`.
3. `playground`: creates a safe testing environment inside of `$(PL)` and provides instructions on how to use `dotful` within it.

Default parameters:
- `BIN` = `/usr/local/bin`
- `PL` = `/tmp/_home`
